# Alien Invasion Game Project
## Project from "Python Crash Course" (2nd Edition), by Eric Matthes

I completed the first part of an alien invasion game created using pygame. The game is created with the help of
some code provided by the book, but doing significant modifications when it is neededâ€”to make work, because
the original code had some bugs

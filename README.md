I completed the first part of an alien invasion game created using pygame. The game is created with the help of
some code provided by the book, but doing significant modifications when it is needed—to make work, because
the original code had some bugs.


With this project I learned basics of object directed programming with python! I also decided to use Git !<img src="readme_images/beggining_git.png" width="200" align=”left”/>
for the first time and synchronized the project on my computer with my github! I learned a lot about Git
with the help of a book.

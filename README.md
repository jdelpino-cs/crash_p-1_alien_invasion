# Alien Invasion Game Project
## Project from *Python Crash Course* (2019) (2nd Edition), by Eric Matthes

I completed the first part of this alien invasion game project completing the basic code the book provides.
The game is built using Pygame, which is also a fun way to learn basics of object oriented programming.

Here some screenshots of the game working!

By the way, *Python crash course* is a very nice book for python begginners and it provides fun projects.
If you are a fan of learning hands-on and you don't know anything about python, you can have fun completing one or more
projects from the book. The 3 projects that the book includes are challeging and fun. Also, the book give you some
foundamentals of debugging and git version control, which is awesome! I actually followed the advice of the book about
the importance of using version control. For this project I also used Git for the first time, commiting my changes,
and synchronizing the project on my computer with my github!

I learned a lot from this book. Together with *Think Python*, i really recommend it as a door of entry to Python.
I dind't kept going with this book, because when I was completing this project I realized that I rather learn python
directly doing data science and computer science projects.
